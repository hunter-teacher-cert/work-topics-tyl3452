1. The following LMC program is supposed to add two input numbers, add them, subtract the third input from the sum, and output the result, i.e.<br> OUT = IN1 + IN2 -- IN3. <br>
  *numeric code* <br>
  `901`<br>
  `399`<br>
  `901`<br>
  `199`<br>
  `399`<br>
  `901`<br>
  `299`<br>
  `902`<br>
  `000`<br>
Your task:
Convert from numeric into mnemonic code. A helpful guide the the LMC instruction set can be found HERE.
The program doesn’t work as intended.  Identify what’s wrong with the program as is.
Modify the program so that it works correctly. Include your code.  
2.  Finally, you’ll write your own LMC program.  *Hint*: Build your program up one step at a time, like any other coding task. Implement your program on an LMC simulator like this one.
*mild*: Write an LMC program that takes two inputs and produces the larger of the two values as an output
*medium*: Write a Little Man program that accepts three values as input and outputs them in order of size, largest to smallest.
*hot* Write an LMC program that adds a column of input values and produces the  sum as output. The first input value will contain the number of values that follow as input to be added.
